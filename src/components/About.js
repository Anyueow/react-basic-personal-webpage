      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Ananya Shah, a startup founder, tech enthusiast, and student. I serve as the Managing Director at Huntington Angels Network (HAN) and was an Entrepreneur in Residence (EIR) at the Michael J. and Ann Sherman Center. I am currently working with a new startup called Tyle.ai, which focuses on proposal automation for RFPs in the construction industry. My passion lies in leveraging technology to optimize business workflows and increase efficiency. With a dedication to innovation and social impact, I have initiated several projects including Social Frame, Bindu, Likd by Anyu, E-Cup, and Fitness Bolt. Bindu has impacted 3000 women by providing education workshops and eco-friendly sanitary kits.</p>
